#### New features:

*   new **fan always on** option
*   **bed temperature control** (first layer/other layers)
*   Growl notifications

#### Improvements:

*   some algorithms are now less complex (thus faster with larger models)
*   fill/perimeter contact is maximized for line pattern
*   slowdown is now triggered regardless of whether a fan is used
*   allow to use config options in start/end G-code, like for output filename pattern
*   throw an error if a user wants to print a 0mm layer
*   remove M82/M83 codes for Makerbot output

#### Changes:

*   the _Use relative E_ option is now back in the GUI
*   remove G0 from the GUI until most firmwares implement it
*   avoid G92 codes for Mach3 output

#### Bugfixes:

*   retraction wasn't triggered when moving between copies
*   a bad "bridge fan end" string was sometimes inserted in G-code
*   fixed some fatal errors
*   fixed some bogus non-manifold errors happening with certain values of first layer height
*   infill extrudates were escaping perimeters sometimes
