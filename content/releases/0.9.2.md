This time no package is available for 64bit Linux. Sorry...

This release and all recent work about support material and multiple extruders is sponsored byÂ [**LulzBot**](http://www.lulzbot.com/). Check out their products!

#### New features:

*   new separate options for retraction length to be used when switching between multiple extruders
*   new option to disable retraction when moving between infill paths inside the same island
*   new option to configure the threshold for enforcing solid infill
*   export plates as AMF constellations (...next version will be able to import them back ;-))

#### Improvements:

*   smarter retraction in multi-extruder prints
*   always connect infill paths, preventing gaps and unnecessary retractions
*   avoid backwards moves when doing honeycomb infill
*   accept newline as separator for post-processing scripts in the GUI

#### Changes:

*   temperature-related M-codes for the Teacup firmware were updated to the most recent ones

#### Bugfixes:

*   the "Delete" button in the Plater was causing crashes
*   brim was positioned incorrectly if no skirt was enabled
*   fixed regression causing some bridges not to be detected correctly
*   crazy temperatures were written when using sequential printing
*   removed warnings caused by output filenames containing the % character
