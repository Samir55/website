This is a very important update: don't miss it and enjoy the goodies!

#### Major new features:

*   a **new rock-solid slicing algorithm**, based on a topological approach, able to process efficiently a wide range of STL files without any warning
*   generation of **support material** (optionally, with a **second extruder**)
*   **cooling** and **fan control**
*   ability to read the **AMF** format

#### New features:

*   **first layer temperature**
*   support for **Makerbot** and **Mach3** G-code flavors
*   duplication is performed on generated toolpaths instead of 3D mesh, resulting in a **nearly-constant time** for any number of object copies
*   infill and support material are **multi-threaded**, so they will take advantage of multiple CPUs/cores
*   support for custom post-processing scripts
*   new notes field in configuration profiles

#### Improvements:

*   uses 40% less memory
*   ability to load multiple config files using the command line
*   ask for confirmation when slicing more than one copy
*   contours and holes are extruded in the same direction (ccw)
*   skein multiple files with a single command from command line
*   some compensation for hole shrinkage

#### Minor improvements:

*   do not display the progress dialog as an application-wide modal dialog
*   Config files are now portable between Unix and Windows and allow for Unicode characters
*   added extrusion multiplier to G-code comments

#### Bugfixes:

*   models with rounded walls had small useless infill regions
*   small perimeter speed was applied to all holes too, regardless of their size
*   fixed some fatal errors
