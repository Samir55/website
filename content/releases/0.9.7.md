#### New features:

*   new distinct settings for support material speed and gap fill speed (the latter one allows to avoid resonance issues when printing the very fast zigzag paths filling thin regions)

#### Improvements:

*   solid fills and bridges are now filled better
*   reduced the amount of zigzag fills to avoid some shaking
*   expose any environment variable starting with SLIC3R_ as placeholder for custom G-code and output filename generation
*   allow setting top-solid-layers and bottom-solid-layers independently
*   use a new algorithm for simplifying the output G-code without changing the shape of the resulting object
*   avoid overextrusion in support material when user configured a too low support spacing

#### Changes:

*   usage of G92 for applying Z offset was reverted as it needs more discussion for special cases that were reported
*   full configuration is appended to G-code files when the --gcode-comments (Verbose G-code) option is set
*   emit M106 S0 instead of M107 for Teacup

#### Bugfixes:

*   retraction wasn't always triggered when moving between distinct objects
*   a bug in an upstream library (Clipper) was fixed that caused crashed when loading many STL files
*   AMF export was not working anymore
*   infill flow for bottom layer was calculated incorrectly when layer height != first layer height
*   object centering was wrong after rotation in the plater
