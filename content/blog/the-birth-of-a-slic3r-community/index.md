Here we are. After two months since I started to write this software from scratch, there are many people enjoying using it. And I'm enjoying to receive their feedback!

[Tech Paladin](http://techpaladin.com/) published a post entitled [Slic3r 0wns](http://techpaladin.com/2011/11/06/slic3r-0wns/) with some pictures:

Joachim Glauche, owner of [RepRapSource.com](http://www.reprapsource.com/) and creator of the [ShaperCube](http://www.shapercube.com/) published some [pictures of nice high-resolution prints](https://picasaweb.google.com/102048359095706720847/Prints) sliced thanks to the speed and accuracy of Slic3r.

Some people printed the same object with Slic3r and Skeinforge and published pictures with the comparison: see [this picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/blue_metal/6341424872) by Blue_Metal, [this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/13659531@N03/6334203975/) by John Ridley.
