10 more days and a new release is there!

#### New features:

*   if _Temperature_ is set to zero, no temperature control will be added to the resulting gcode file

#### Improvements:

*   **large refactoring** of the bridging logic - all bridges should now be detected (although some work needs to be done on optimal infill direction); the quality of solid surfaces and regions near bridges and solid surfaces has improved a lot
*   use solid infill under pillars and small regions instead of using an internal low-density infill
*   don't die on non-manifold models; always try to generate some output

#### Changes:

*   print settings moved to first tab
*   M109 is used instead of M104 for temperature control

#### Bugfixes:

*   bottom layer speed was ignored
*   some solid layers were skipped
*   some ghost lines were extruded in open air outside the object when a 45° infill angle was used
