After much work, a new beefy release of Slic3r is ready for download.

#### New features:

*   **thin walls!**
*   newÂ _Output Filename Format_ option to allow for complex output filenames using option values (like_foo_3perimeters_0.15height.gcode_)
*   automatic retraction at the end of the print

#### Improvements:

*   much better overlap between infill and perimeters in those situations where previous version was still producing gaps
*   smarter order for hole perimeters to save travel and time
*   large internal refactoring (less memory and some speed)
*   bridges now have higher priority than other solid regions
*   loops are now closed better
*   use solid print speed for internal solid layers too
*   checkbox in GUI to enable comments in G-code
*   warn if no layers were detected

#### Changes:

*   Windows package is now distributed as a ZIP file rather than a self-extracting executable

#### Bugfixes:

*   some island having no holes and contained in holes themselves were ignored
*   fatal error in arc detection code
*   wrong month number in output
*   small regions were infilled even with fill_density = 0
*   fill was escaping perimeters near some corners
*   other fatal errors removed, especially when dealing with dirty files
