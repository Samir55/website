The previous release contained a bug which caused blobbing on layer change, so you're urged to download this one before yelling at your favorite slicing program!

#### New features:

*   new options to **customize support material**: pattern, spacing, overhang angle threshold, pattern angle
*   new option to **disable the automatic addition of perimeters** for sloping walls
*   new _brim_ feature to improve adhesion (as requested by the community!)

#### Improvements:

*   **support material now works with all geometries** (not just flat overhangs)
*   perimeters now keep the **full accuracy and resolution** of the original model
*   honeycomb travel moves were optimized

#### Changes:

*   skirt loops are now extruded from outside to inside
*   arc geometry compensation was disabled

#### Bugfixes:

*   any _retraction_lift_ value different from "0" caused no retraction on layer change, thus blobbing
*   _first_layer_speed_ was accepting mm/m values rather than mm/s
*   some infill lines were not always connected near the perimeters
*   ratio inputs were not accepted on command line
*   ratio inputs were always converted to absolute values on config saving
*   when skirt distance was set to zero, the first loop coincided with the external perimeter of the object
*   first layer extrusion width was computed using general layer height rather first layer height
