(I would like to thank, among others, @stepanb and Microsoft Czech for their support.)

#### Major new features:



*   built-in **automatic STL repair**
*   OpenGL **3D preview** of the repaired file (thanks to iXce for the initial work); also supports multi-material files
*   ability to override individual **config options for each object** in the same print job
*   **new support material** rewritten from scratch
*   new **Ooze Prevention** feature for multiple extruders (park extruders outside skirt and drop temperature by a specified delta)





*   options to avoid starting loops on convex vertices and/or overhangs
*   **volume calculation**
*   ability to customize how materials are mapped to extruders
*   new First Layer Acceleration option
*   new option to use firmware-controlled retraction (G10/G11)
*   new option to use a distinct extruder for support material interface





#### Improvements:

*   Slic3r is now **much faster** because many mature parts of code were rewritten in C++ for faster processing and less memory usage (Slic3r is now **40% C++**)
*   most of memory is now truly **shared between threads**, reducing the total footprint
*   **improved infill** patterns and **bridge detection**
*   the automated test suite was largely enriched
*   don't combine retract and travel anymore when using G0 (Mach3 compatibility)
*   better Makerbot (Makerware/Sailfish) compatibility
*   Windows binaries are now built with Expat for faster AMF parsing



#### Minor improvements:

*   new [layer_num] placeholder in layer-change G-code
*   custom G-code can be supplied via command line too
*   some options were renamed or rearranged for clarity
*   new --info command line option to get information about the file
*   add .ngc to supported G-code suffixes
*   the wizard now saves initial profiles automatically
*   automatically copy Simple Mode settings into a 'Simple Mode' preset in Expert Mode



#### Changes:

*   layer height ranges are scaled automatically when object is scaled in plater
*   avoid G92 E0 for sailfish output
*   the "Infill every n layers" option was renamed to "Combine infill every n layers" to clarify its purpose



#### Bugfixes (1.0.0 final):

*   crash when using the _Infill only where needed_ option
*   bridge speed was not used for the first solid layer above sparse infill
*   a few models were sliced incorrectly and had solid bridges in random places
*   exporting binary STL files produced corrupt results on Windows
*   holes were not sorted using a nearest-neighbor search, resulting in inefficient paths
*   crash when user entered Unicode characters in notes
*   wrong wiping moves for hole perimeters were calculated for the second copy of an object

#### Bugfixes (1.0.0RC3):

*   facets were completely reversed because of an overflow triggered by STL files with very large coordinates
*   rectilinear infill was exceeding perimeters when using very low layer height
*   random lack of infill caused by recent changes aimed at reducing memory usage
*   incorrect number of raft layers was geenrated when too few were requested
*   fatal error in the rare case that a bridge has no valid anchor points
*   fatal error when concentric infill generated too tight loops
*   spiral vase generated some wrong layers
*   when processing with fill_density = 0, top/bottom solid shells were missing regions thinner than three times the extrusion width
*   the M73 command used with makerware/sailfish G-code flavor exceeded 100% under certain circumstances

#### Bugfixes (1.0.0RC2):

*   the Windows 64-bit package was missing an OpenGL library
*   the Linux packages were missing XML::SAX thus weren't able to load AMF files
*   a regression caused all perimeter holes to be completed doing contours instead of finishing one island at time
*   retraction restarts ignored the extrusion_axis setting
*   objects could not be repositioned in plater after hitting the Split button
*   Z moves were skipped after the first object was complete when using Sequential Printing
*   objects were incorrectly placed in exported STL files
*   fixed a fatal error related to thin walls
*   fixed random crashes (mostly visible on 32-bit Windows)
*   the Avoid Crossing Perimeters implementation was rewritten in order to fix some regressions and make it faster
*   fan wasn't enabled when vibration limit or another internal post-processor was enabled
*   raft wasn't generated for the entire object footprint
*   thin walls came out as zig-zag paths instead of straight lines
*   narrow gaps were not infilled under certain circumstances

#### Bugfixes (1.0.0RC1):

*   several threading issues were fixed
*   some situations causing incomplete infill were fixed
*   fixed regression causing wrong direction for inwards move in holes, thus little blobs
*   fix crash on Windows when username had non-ASCII characters
*   some spiral vase prints had little gaps in the loops
*   Z-offset was not applied to spiral vase prints
*   lift was not working correctly with multiple extruders and multiple skirt layers
*   fix speed math for wipe, which was causing too fast retraction
*   other minor fixes
