This is a bugfix-only release.

Also, this is a **stable** release. Ideally, it is considered to be bug-free. :-)

#### Improvements:

*   support config files saved with 1.1.x

#### Bugfixes:

*   sometimes a tiny gap was left between infill and perimeters
*   _Infill only where needed_ did not work properly anymore
