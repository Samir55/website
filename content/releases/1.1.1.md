This is anÂ **experimental** release. Help us testing!

For the full list of new features see the [release notes for 1.1.0](/releases/1.1.0).


#### Improvements:



*   Faster loading/refreshing of presets (thanks sapir for the patch)
*   Faster G-code export
*   Preserve alignment of meshes when composing parts in the Object Editor
*   Better gap fill

#### Changes:



*   Always complete one island at time (perimeter -> infill -> next island -> perimeter -> infill) instead of doing that only when _Avoid crossing perimeters_ is enabled. This leads to fewer travel moves, faster prints and is more consistent with what already happens when a print contains more copies and/or objects

#### Bug fixes:



*   The Y coordinate of point config fields was not correctly validated
*   Crash when setting number of extruders
*   Crash when using multiple skirts with a single, non-zero, extruder
*   Incomplete/sparse extrusion on solid surfaces
*   The threads config option was not enabled anymore
*   Command-line --scale and --retract-layer-change options were not working properly
*   Presets were listed in random order
*   Pillars support material crashed when no overhangs were detected
*   Bridge angle detection was failing in many cases (thanks ledvinap for patches and debugging)
*   Linux packages for 1.1.0 were broken
*   Sometimes a tiny gap was left between infill and perimeters
*   _Infill only where needed_ was not working properly anymore
*   _Avoid crossing perimeters_ was not considering some possible routes
*   Default extruder was not applied to perimeter extruder
*   [filament_preset] placeholder (and other *_preset) was not replaced in output filenames
*   Crash when using concentric solid infill
*   Input fields had focus issues on Windows



#### Known issues:

*   An upstream bug in the Clipper library causes some random perimeter segments to be swapped in order ([#1834](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/1834))
