After 10 more days of work, a new release is out!

#### New features:

*   **four** new exciting fill patterns (including _line_)!
*   new algorithm for re-processing layers with dirty geometry, this makes the parser more tolerant
*   start and end gcode is customizable in the GUI too
*   new --retract-lift option to lift Z while doing travel moves
*   new --no-extrusion option to disable E codes
*   new --skirt-height option
*   new --first-layer-height-ratio option
*   new --close-after-slicing for easy integration with external programs
*   new --g0 option to output G0 for fast retractions (experimental)

#### Improvements:

*   perimeters are extruded at once for each island, saving on travel toolpaths
*   perimeters are extruded using a shortest path search, avoiding unnecessary travel
*   smarter toolpaths for infills with different density
*   _multiply_ was renamed to _duplicate_
*   infill is now overlapped with perimeters by 15%
*   GUI was rearranged using tabs

#### Bugfixes:

*   fixed fatal error occuring on Windows
*   infill solid layers even when --fill-density is set to zero
*   membranes were not printed correctly
*   G2/G3 coordinates for experimental arcs were wrong
*   print first layer at Z = 1 * layer height instead of zero
