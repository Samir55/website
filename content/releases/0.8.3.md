This release aims to fix pending bugs and address stability. A number of [contributors](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/commits/master) helped with patches and testing. Note: the Mac executable requires OS X 10.6\. I'm working on a 10.5 package; meanwhile, Mac Leopard users can use 0.7.2b.

#### New features:

*   new advanced options to _customize extrusion width_ for first layer, perimeters and infill
*   new separate **speed setting for top solid surfaces**
*   new algorithm to **fill gaps** (corners, little regions, vase walls only allowing for an odd number of loops etc.)
*   experimental support material generation for DLP in SVG export

#### Improvements:

*   better detection of _thin walls_
*   avoid perimeter collisions
*   accept both relative and absolute values for extrusion width, first layer speed, first layer height (relative values can be expressed as percentage, e.g. _80%_)
*   allow to load multiple files at once in the plater
*   always ask confirmation when overwriting existing STL files
*   warn user when an object can't be split
*   pass config options as environment variables to post-processing scripts

#### Changes:

*   renamed "Perimeters" to "Perimeters (minimum)" to avoid confusion caused by automatic additional perimeters
*   renamed _bottom layer speed_ to _first layer speed_ for consistency
*   always set bed temperature after first layer if first layer temperature is set

#### Bugfixes:

*   fixed regression causing many bridges to be extruded with a wrong direction
*   fixed regression causing skirt to be limited to the first layer
*   fixed regression causing some models not to be sliced correctly
*   fixed regression causing SVG export to be incomplete
*   arc compensation was applied to non-circular holes too, causing them to be too large
*   retraction wasn't triggered when moving between infill of different islands using low density infill
*   fixed _slic3r-console.exe_ (on Windows) not working in previous 0.8.x releases
*   Z wasn't lifted when changing layer
*   the preview area was not updating to the largest side of the build plate
*   the _Export SVG..._ menu item was not working
*   Growl notifications now work from the plater too
