I recently visited [Josef Prusa](http://josefprusa.cz/) in Prague (yes, that Josef Prusa: the world-known author of the [Prusa Mendel](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel) printer and RepRap core developer).

We recorded a talk about many topics including Slic3r, 3D printing, community, funding, bad vendors and open development. Check it out!

(Some days ago Josef got a [new tattoo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/prusajr/7976596252/in/photostream) on his arm. Do you recognize it? It's Slic3r hexagonal infill! :-P)
