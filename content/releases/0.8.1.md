This is a very important update, grab it now and enjoy! I want to say thanks to the wonderful community that has been helping with feedback, early testing and nice ideas. A lot of people is involved in our open "quality assurance" process!

#### New features:

*   **graphical interface for composing multiple objects** in one single print (with tools for rotation, scaling etc.)
*   new **--merge** switch to compose multiple object with auto-positioning from command line
*   new option to **randomize starting points** across layers
*   automatic detection of additional required perimeters for avoiding haps in domed/sloping objects (the _perimeters_ settings means now _minimum perimeters_ as Slic3r could add more when needed)
*   **sequential printing**: print a complete object, then move onto next one, with automatic collision detection
*   ability to **export STL** files of composed plates, as well as a **Split**command to turn multi-object files into individual objects
*   we can read **OBJ** files now

#### Improvements:

*   **very large memory savings** and speed boosts, allowing to process high-resolutions files without getting out of memory; also, the number of threads is customizable
*   very **improved surface quality** due to new smoothing algorithms
*   the GUI doesn't block while slicing and a **Cancel** button was added to stop the process
*   hole perimeters are extruded in reverse order (from the outermost to the innermost) to get better overhangs
*   a slight compensation is applied to avoid small hole shrinkage
*   support material now uses honeycomb pattern (much work is still needed on support material)
*   retract before changing tool for dual extrusion

#### Changes:

*   SVG colors were inverted to better support DLP printing (next versions will carry more settings for SVG export)

#### Bugfixes:

*   fixed some GUI memory leaks
*   fixed some fatal errors
*   fixed a bug causing high memory consumption when infilling every 2 or more layers
*   some holes where filled
*   some nearly-thin walls were discarded
*   removed tiny dots/blobs that were generated sometimes
*   bottom layer speed ratio wasn't taken into account when estimating layer time
*   omit any G92 E0 when in relative mode
