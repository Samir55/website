We have a shiny new beautiful icon now! Thanks to [Corey Daniels](https://twitter.com/cdugd/) for designing it.

#### Major new features:

*   **Honeycomb (hexagonal) infill pattern!**
*   **SVG export** for DLP printers and other purposes
*   **automatic arrangement** for printing multiple copies of the same object (thanks Triffid Hunter for contributing this one)

#### New features:

*   new **Reslice** command in the File menu
*   customizable G-code to be executed at layer change

#### Improvements:

*   huge **speed boost (20%-50%)** and more parallelization of long-running algorithms
*   new implementation of **support material** generation
*   don't slow down travel moves when cooling is enabled
*   new _--threads_ command line option to set number of parallel jobs

#### Minor improvements:

*   enable G0 automatically for Mach3
*   allow decimal values for skirt/duplicate distances and speeds
*   added the coordinates of the first non-manifold edge to the warning messages
*   only output M109 if there's none in the user-supplied start G-code
*   make sure all concentric fill loops are extruded in the same direction to prevent sudden changes of direction

#### Changes:

*   _--duplicate-x_ and _--duplicate-y_ were merged into a single _--duplicate-grid_ option

#### Bugfixes:

*   some holes were filled
*   the _No Extrusion_ mode had no effect
*   use M109 for bed control (Makerbot)
*   use P instead of S for M106 (Mach3)
*   fixed some fatal errors
