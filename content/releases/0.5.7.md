#### New features:

*   _Slice and save as..._ command to **choose the output file name**
*   Compatibility with Windows XP 64
*   Total filament length is written to the output file and showed on command line

#### Improvements:

*   **Improved flow and overlapping for solid surfaces** by using a better physical model in internal calculations; this gives much**higher quality** making it less sparse then it was before
*   Improved the slicing algorithm; this should **reduce the STL warnings**
*   Better overlapping for loops
*   Concentric infill now uses the adjusted flow spacing for better surface quality; it also starts infilling always from the center point.
*   **Reduced packages size** by 10-20%; they also launch faster
*   Always use rectilinear infill for internal solid surfaces
*   Limit skirt height to print height

#### Bugfixes:

*   Concentric infill was throwing errors
*   Extrusion was calculated incorrectly for clock-wise arcs when using the experimental _--gcode-arcs_ option
