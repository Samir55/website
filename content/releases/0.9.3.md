*   print **multi-material files**!
*   **save and load plates**
*   new option to force a solid layer after a given number of layers
*   convert multiple STL files into a single multi-material AMF file

#### Improvements:

*   _less memory usage_ when the graphical interface is used
*   rotation and scaling in the plater is a lot faster
*   better randomization for layer starting points
*   better adhesion of brim and support material
*   parts positions are preserved when an object is split in the plater
*   new _[print_preset]_, _[filament_preset]_ and _[printer_preset]_placeholders for file names

#### Changes:

*   use support material extruder for brim

#### Bugfixes:

*   _only retract when crossing perimeters_ was still retracting too much
*   the _--datadir_ command line option was ignored
*   _support material extrusion width_ was almost not honored
