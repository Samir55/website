A new release just after two days!

#### New features:

*   new **Extrusion width ratio** option to force a given ratio between extrusion width and layer height instead of having Slic3r calculate it automatically
*   new super-fast **concentric** infill pattern

#### Improvements:

*   GUI progress bar is not determinate and shows some information
*   avoid unnecessary retractions during infill

#### Changes:

*   _Filament packing density_ was renamed to _Extrusion multiplier_

#### Bugfixes:

*   _Infill every 'n' layers_ was broken after recent changes
*   setting _Temperature_ to zero didn't remove it from output
