Okay, Slic3r was born in September and in a few months I was able to bring it beyond what I expected, in terms of features, speed and stability. Things have started to **change very quickly**, and **community** is playing a big role in testing and discussing new features.

A [**Slic3r forum**](https://forums.reprap.org/list.php?263) was created in the official RepRap forums. Also, about 50 people sit in the [FreeNode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) IRC #slic3r channel.

Some notable things appeared in the web recently. Neil Underwood (well known as [Spacexula](http://repraplogphase.blogspot.com/)) posted pictures and a video of a print he did on the [official RepRap blog](http://blog.reprap.org/2011/12/001-layer-height-on-prusa-mendel.html). The first outstanding thing is that he reached a**0.01mm layer height**. The second outstanding thing is that **he used Slic3r**!

Richard H. (well known as [Richrap](http://richrap.blogspot.com/)) is posting a multipart [**illustrated Slic3r guide**](http://richrap.blogspot.com/2012/01/slic3r-is-nicer-part-1-settings-and.html) to his colorful blog. It's a very good work, so thank you Rich!

Michael Andresen (well known as [blddk](http://captain-slow.dk/)) posted [some screenshots](http://captain-slow.dk/2011/12/29/slic3r-fill-options/http://captain-slow.dk/2011/12/29/slic3r-fill-options/) to show differences between the various **fill patterns** available in Slic3r. Don't miss the interesting article Gary Hodgson posted about [new possible fill patterns](http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2012/01/thoughts-on-fill-algorithms/).

[Pointedstick](http://techpaladin.com/) (Nathaniel Graham) posted two good blog articles about **high-resolution printing**, in which he talks about using Slic3r: [this](http://techpaladin.com/2011/11/21/getting-all-the-pieces-to-fit-together/) and [that](http://techpaladin.com/2011/12/21/nathaniels-guide-to-high-detail-printing/).

[Brazen Artifice](http://brazenartifice.wordpress.com/) posted a couple articles about [retraction](http://brazenartifice.wordpress.com/2011/12/31/retraction-solution-with-marlin-pronterface-and-slic3r/) and [preloading last settings](http://brazenartifice.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/teaching-slic3r-to-remember-your-settings/).

Sparr posted a picture of an [object he printed](http://blog.freesideatlanta.org/2011/12/reprap-firmware-comparison-smoother.html) with and without enabling the **native arcs support** in Slic3r.

The good [Kliment Yanev](https://github.com/kliment) added an option to customize the slicing command in his excellent [Pronterface](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun), to allow for easy **integration with Slic3r**. (See the [Slic3r README](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/blob/master/README.markdown) for guidance.)
