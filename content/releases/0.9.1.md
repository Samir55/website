Wow - the 0.9.0 release produced an impressive amount of feedback. Here's a quick new release for your summer.

This release and all recent work about support material and multiple extruders is sponsored by [**LulzBot**](http://www.lulzbot.com/). Check out their products!

#### New features:

*   retraction settings can be customized for each extruder now
*   a 64bit package is now available for Windows too (Win7 users will benefit from this)

#### Improvements:

*   allow exporting with the _.g_ extension too
*   accept multiple _--load_ arguments for GUI too

#### Changes:

*   pressing the Enter key from the configuration tabs doesn't trigger slicing anymore

#### Bugfixes:

*   exporting configuration produced unexpected/incomplete behavior when an external configuration was loaded before
*   saving a printer preset with less extruder than before resulted in the same number of extruders
*   skirt height and other options were limited to 100
*   random failures to load presets and config files
