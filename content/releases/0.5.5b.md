#### New features:

*   optimal bridging direction is detected for more bridges
*   flow width is auto adjusted to avoid leaving gaps at the border of solid regions
*   customizable speed for small perimeters
*   customizable multiplier for the flow rate used when bridging

#### Improvements:

*   important settings are marked in bold -- new users can start printing by changing only those ones
*   infill segments are now connected to allow better sticking to the perimeters

#### Bugfixes:

*   0.5.4 was less tolerant than 0.5.3 about dirty STL models
