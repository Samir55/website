This is an experimental release. Help us testing!

For the full list of new features see also the [release notes for 1.1.0](/releases/1.1.0) and [1.1.2](/releases/1.1.2).


#### New features:



*   New **Seam position** option to configure the logic for choosing the start point of perimeters
*   New **distinct speed** option for **support material interface**
*   Most speed settings can now be configured for each object and and sub-part instead of globally



#### Improvements:

*   Don't emit any temperature command if standby temperature delta is set to zero
*   Use last extruder's settings when adding new ones ([#1997](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/1997))
*   Seam is forced to be aligned in spiral vase mode even when the original model hasn't got aligned vertices to put it at ([#2023](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2023))
*   Thin fill loops are started at the nearest point for minimizing travel ([#1990](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/1990))

#### Changes:

*   Skirt and brim are now printed with support material speed instead of perimeter speed



#### Bug fixes:





*   Fixed several issues in perimeter printer order when overhangs were detected
*   Brim and skirt from previous slicing job were not cleared when disabled after it ([#2024](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2024))
*   Excessive support material was generated when using both raft and support material ([#2030](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2030))
*   _Ooze prevention_ and _Sequential printing_ generated excessively long travel moves which could easily go out of print area ([#2013](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2013), [#2007](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2007))
*   _First layer extrusion width_ wasn't affecting infill ([#2042](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2042))
*   Incomplete config was written in G-code comments ([#2047](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2047), [#2032](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2032))
*   Config validation was not reported to user when using the Export G-code button in plater ([#2046](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2046))
*   Don't crash when loading config files with empty strings in multi-value options ([#2003](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2003))
*   Thin walls forming a closed loop had overlapping segments at their endpoints ([#1948](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/1948), [#1875](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/1875))
*   Fixed minor issues caused by bugs in the upstream Clipper library (thanks Angus Johnson)
*   Wrong handling of large number of raft layers ([#2041](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2041))
*   Crash when exporting SVG from object containing multiple islands ([#2050](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/2050))
*   Regression caused crash when splitting objects from GUI
*   Minor crashes in GUI
