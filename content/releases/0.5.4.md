A new juicy release is ready!

#### New features:

*   distinct speeds for perimeters, infill, solid infill and bridges
*   warn about non-manifold or dirty models
*   allow solid fill layers to be zero
*   new _--extrusion-axis_ option

#### Improvements:

*   high tolerance for dirty models; it will attempt to repair any missing layer (all Prusa Mendel parts now slice correctly!)
*   options on command line now override loaded config file
*   note used settings in exported gcode

#### Changes:

*   all _feed rate_ options were renamed using the word _speed_

#### Bugfixes:

*   concentric infill threw errors
*   plate was lifted erroneously at Z change
*   fill density = 0 prevented generation of extra solid layers
*   some bridges, when very close to other solid surfaces, could lead to overlapping infill
*   the _extrusion width ratio_ setting produced wrong flow rate sometimes
*   removed sparse errors
*   could not read back a config file with empty start or end gcode
