#### New features:



*   ability to **fill small gaps** using multiple automatic extrusion widths
*   **object information** is displayed when double-clicking on an item in the plater
*   independently set **number of top/bottom solid layers**
*   descriptive textual feedback for cooling settings
*   allow _[print_center_X]_ and _[print_center_Y]_ syntax for all coordinates settings (including bed_center etc.) and _[temperature_0]_, _[temperature_1]_ etc. for all index-based settings
*   new _min_skirt_length_ option to ensure that the specified amount of filament is always consumed while extruding skirt
*   (experimental) make a little move inwards by 30Â° before leaving the last perimeter loops



#### Improvements:



*   **dual-extruder printing** was tested and heavily improved
*   if brim overlaps with skirt, make brim around skirt too instead of just skipping skirt on bottom layer
*   paths are much smoother, without any artifacts
*   useless extra perimeters were generated sometimes
*   speed improvements
*   make external perimeter first on bottom layer when brim is enabled
*   distribute skirt loops among all extruders
*   remember last used filaments when using multiple extruders too
*   use a faster XML parser for AMF if available
*   don't apply slowdown factor to bridges
*   make a slightly thinner interface layer at the top of support material (nophead's idea)
*   expose perimeter/infill/support material extrusion widths in G-code comments



#### Changes:



*   bottom layer infill is not taken into account for combination
*   use G92 to apply Z offset



#### Bugfixes:



*   tool number written in multi-extruder G-code were wrong
*   the Split button didn't work anymore
*   first layer extrusion width was ignored for skirt and sometimes for other parts too
*   the copies number was not updated when decreasing parts in the plater
*   honeycomb infill was overlapping too much with perimeters
*   the plater was merging all materials into a single-material print
*   worked around a wxWidgets issue causing the last changed setting in the GUI to be ignored when saving the preset
*   bed temperature wasn't being set after the first layer when first layer bed temperature was set to zero
*   fixed regression causing one perimeter to be generated even when perimeters were set to 0
*   fixed regression causing too much clipping at the endpoints of loops
